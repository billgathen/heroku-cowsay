# Heroku Cowsay

Sample clock application demonstrating basic setup for a [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) app on [Heroku](http://heroku.com), using Avdi Grimm's [Cowsay](https://github.com/avdi/cowsay) library and the [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) web server.

See it in action at https://thawing-scrubland-2260.herokuapp.com/ but if that link is dead, fork it and deploy your own! ;)
